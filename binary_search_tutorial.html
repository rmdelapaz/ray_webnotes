        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of an element in a sorted array. By repeatedly dividing the array in half, binary search significantly reduces the number of comparisons needed to find the target element. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how binary search works, when to use it, and how to implement it in JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Code Example: Binary Search</h2>
        <p>Here’s an example of binary search implemented in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre><code>function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;  // Target found
        if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;  // Search right half
        else right = mid - 1;  // Search left half
    }
    return -1;  // Target not found
}</code></pre>
        <p>This function works by comparing the target element with the middle element of the array. If the target is equal to the middle element, it returns the index. Otherwise, it narrows the search to either the left or right half of the array, depending on whether the target is smaller or larger.</p>

        <h2>Analogy: Searching a Book</h2>
        <p>Imagine you’re searching for a word in a dictionary. Instead of starting from the first page and flipping through every page (like in linear search), you can open the dictionary in the middle. If the word you’re looking for is alphabetically before or after the current page, you discard half the pages and continue searching in the remaining half. This is exactly how binary search works, cutting down the search space by half with each step.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Example: Finding a Name in a Sorted List</h2>
        <p>Suppose you have a list of names sorted alphabetically, and you want to find the index of a specific name. Instead of checking each name one by one, you can use binary search to quickly narrow down the list:</p>
        <pre><code>const names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'];
const index = binarySearch(names, 'Charlie');  // Output: 2</code></pre>
        <p>Binary search finds "Charlie" at index 2 much faster than linear search would, especially if the list contains thousands of names.</p>

        <h2>Metaphor: Splitting the Cake</h2>
        <p>Imagine you have a cake and you’re trying to find a specific decoration on it. Instead of checking the entire cake, you cut it in half. If the decoration is on the left half, you discard the right half and continue searching the left. If it’s on the right half, you discard the left half. By cutting the search space in half at each step, you quickly find the decoration. This is how binary search splits the array to locate the target efficiently.</p>

        <h2>Why Use Binary Search?</h2>
        <p>Binary search is much faster than linear search, especially for large datasets. It reduces the time complexity from <code>O(n)</code> in linear search to <code>O(log n)</code> in binary search, making it highly efficient for searching through sorted data. However, the array must be sorted for binary search to work, so it’s important to ensure that the data is ordered before using this algorithm.</p>

        <h2>Practical Usage</h2>
        <p>Binary search is widely used in applications that involve searching through large datasets, such as database indexing, searching in phone books, or finding records in a sorted file. It’s also used in algorithms that require quick lookup operations, such as in tree-based data structures like binary search trees (BSTs).</p>
