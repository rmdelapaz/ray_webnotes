    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A two-dimensional (2D) array is an array of arrays, allowing data to be stored in a grid or table format. It is a powerful way to represent structures like matrices, grids, and game boards in programming. In this tutorial, we will explore two-dimensional arrays, how they work, and how to use them effectively in JavaScript.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Code Example: Creating a Two-Dimensional Array</h2>
        <p>Here’s how to create a two-dimensional array in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre><code>const array2D = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
];</code></pre>
        <p>This creates a 3x3 matrix, where each element in the outer array is itself an array (a row in the grid). You can access elements by using two indices: the first for the row and the second for the column.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Analogy: A Chessboard</h2>
        <p>Think of a two-dimensional array like a chessboard. The rows represent the ranks, and the columns represent the files. Each square on the chessboard can be accessed using a pair of coordinates (row, column). In a 2D array, each element can similarly be accessed by specifying its row and column indices.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Accessing Elements in a Two-Dimensional Array</h2>
        <p>You can access and manipulate elements in a two-dimensional array using two sets of brackets:</p>
        <pre><code>console.log(array2D[1][2]);  // Output: 6</code></pre>
        <p>This accesses the element at row 1, column 2 (remember, indices are zero-based). You can also modify values at specific locations:</p>
        <pre><code>array2D[2][0] = 10;  // Change value at row 2, column 0
console.log(array2D);  // Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 8, 9]]</code></pre>
    </section>

        <h2>Real-World Example: Representing a Spreadsheet</h2>
        <p>Two-dimensional arrays are frequently used to represent tables or spreadsheets, where data is organized in rows and columns. For example, you can represent a simple spreadsheet with numbers as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>const spreadsheet = [
    ['Name', 'Age', 'City'],
    ['Alice', 30, 'New York'],
    ['Bob', 25, 'Los Angeles']
];</code></pre>
        <p>You can access specific data by referencing the row and column:</p>
        <pre><code>console.log(spreadsheet[1][0]);  // Output: Alice</code></pre>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Metaphor: A Table in a Restaurant</h2>
        <p>Imagine you're in a restaurant where each table has rows and columns of chairs. If you want to tell someone where to sit, you specify the row and column (like "second row, third seat"). Similarly, in a two-dimensional array, you specify a position with two indices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Iterating Through a Two-Dimensional Array</h2>
        <p>You can iterate over a two-dimensional array using nested loops. The outer loop iterates through the rows, and the inner loop iterates through the columns:</p>
        <pre><code>for (let i = 0; i < array2D.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < array2D[i].length; j++) {
        console.log(array2D[i][j]);
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>This prints all the elements in the 2D array row by row. You can use this structure to perform operations on each element in the grid, such as calculating sums, finding specific values, or transforming the data.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Why Use Two-Dimensional Arrays?</h2>
        <p>Two-dimensional arrays are useful when working with data that has a grid-like structure. They are commonly used in mathematical operations (like matrices), game development (for grids or boards), and representing tabular data (like spreadsheets). They allow you to store and manipulate complex data structures in an organized and efficient way.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Usage</h2>
        <p>Two-dimensional arrays are widely used in simulations (such as Conway’s Game of Life), image processing (representing pixels as rows and columns), and data tables (such as CSV data). They provide a simple way to model and manipulate multi-dimensional data in many real-world applications.</p>
