    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, especially in Node.js, handling user input can be a critical task, particularly when building
            command-line applications. One of the most useful modules for capturing user input in a Node.js environment is the
            <code>readline</code> module. This module allows for interaction with the user via the command line, making it
            perfect for building interactive tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use the <code>readline</code> module to capture user input and how to handle
            multiple asynchronous tasks in a relative order using callback chaining. We'll also introduce analogies, examples, 
            and real-world scenarios to deepen your understanding of these concepts.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding the Readline Module</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>readline</code> module provides an interface for reading data from a readable stream, such as the process's
            standard input (stdin). In simpler terms, it allows us to "ask" the user for input and then "listen" to their response.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a quick analogy to help understand this concept:</p>
        <p>
            Imagine you're at a coffee shop, and the cashier (Node.js) asks you for your order (input). You respond by telling the
            cashier what you'd like (output), and they process your order. This communication happens asynchronously; the cashier
            can serve other customers (other operations) while you're still deciding.
        </p>

        <h3>Basic Usage of Readline</h3>
        <p>To use the <code>readline</code> module, you first need to import it and set up an interface:</p>

        <pre><code>
// Import the readline module
const readline = require('readline');

// Create an interface for user input
const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

// Ask a question and handle the user's response
rl.question('What is your name? ', (answer) => {
    console.log("Hello, " + answer + "!");
    rl.close();
});
        </code></pre>

        <p>In this example, we use <code>rl.question</code> to prompt the user for their name. Once the user enters their name, 
        the callback function is executed, printing a greeting to the console.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Callback Chaining: Ensuring Order of Execution</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is asynchronous, meaning operations like reading user input, fetching data from a server, or writing files
            do not block the execution of the rest of the program. This asynchronous behavior is powerful, but it can also create
            challenges when we need tasks to occur in a specific order.
        </p>
        <p>Hereâ€™s where callback chaining comes in.</p>
        <p>
            Think of callback chaining like a sequence of tasks: You need to wake up, get dressed, eat breakfast, and then head 
            out for work. Each task is dependent on the previous one being completed. You can't eat breakfast before waking up!
        </p>

        <h3>Callback Chaining in Action</h3>
        <p>
            Let's modify our earlier <code>readline</code> example to ask multiple questions in a specific order, ensuring that 
            each question waits for the user's response before moving on to the next one.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

function askName(callback) {
    rl.question('What is your name? ', (name) => {
        console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
        callback();
    });
}

function askAge(callback) {
    rl.question('How old are you? ', (age) => {
        console.log("You are " + age + " years old.");
        callback();
    });
}

function askHobby(callback) {
    rl.question('What is your favorite hobby? ', (hobby) => {
        console.log("Your hobby is " + hobby + ".");
        callback();
    });
}

// Callback chaining
askName(() => {
    askAge(() => {
        askHobby(() => {
            rl.close();
        });
    });
});
        </code></pre>

        <p>In this example, we're using callback functions to ensure that each question is asked in sequence. Once the user answers
        the first question, we call the next function, and so on, until all the questions have been asked.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Real-World Applications of Callback Chaining</h2>
        <p>
            Callback chaining is commonly used when multiple asynchronous operations need to happen in sequence. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading user input, processing the data, and saving the result to a file.</li>
            <li>Fetching data from multiple APIs where the results of one API call depend on the previous one.</li>
            <li>Creating a multi-step signup form where each step needs to be completed in order.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to Use Callback Chaining</h3>
        <p>Callback chaining is useful when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have multiple asynchronous tasks that need to happen in a specific order.</li>
            <li>Each step depends on the completion of the previous step.</li>
            <li>You want to maintain readability and control over your asynchronous code.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Advanced Concepts: Promises and Async/Await</h2>
        <p>
            While callback chaining is a good way to handle sequential asynchronous tasks, it can become difficult to manage as the 
            number of tasks grows (often referred to as "callback hell"). To avoid this, JavaScript introduced <strong>Promises</strong>
            and later, <strong>async/await</strong> syntax, which provide more elegant ways to handle asynchronous operations.
        </p>
        <p>Here's an example using Promises:</p>

        <pre><code>
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

function askQuestion(query) {
    return new Promise(resolve => rl.question(query, resolve));
}

async function main() {
    const name = await askQuestion('What is your name? ');
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");

    const age = await askQuestion('How old are you? ');
    console.log("You are " + age + " years old.");

    const hobby = await askQuestion('What is your favorite hobby? ');
    console.log("Your hobby is " + hobby + ".");

    rl.close();
}

main();
        </code></pre>

        <p>In this example, we use Promises and <code>async/await</code> to write asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable
        way, avoiding deeply nested callbacks.</p>
