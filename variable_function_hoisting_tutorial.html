        <h2>Introduction to Hoisting</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, hoisting refers to the behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means you can use a variable or function before it is declared in the code. But how does this affect variables declared with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>? In this tutorial, we'll explore the details of hoisting, how it works with both variables and functions, and why it's important to understand.</p>

        <h2>What is Variable and Function Hoisting?</h2>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine you are setting up for a play. Before the performance starts, the stage (JavaScript engine) makes sure that all the actors (variables and functions) know where to stand, even if their lines (assignments) haven't been given yet. This is similar to hoisting, where variable and function declarations are brought to the "top" of their scope before the code executes.</p>
        <p>Hoisting allows you to use functions before they are defined, but the way variables are hoisted depends on how they are declared: with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Function Hoisting</h2>
        <p>Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, allowing you to call them before they are declared in the code.</p>
        <pre><code>// Function declaration (hoisted)
sayHello();
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
// Output: "Hello, world!"
</code></pre>
        <p>This behavior is convenient because it allows you to structure your code in a way that makes it more readable, where high-level logic can come before helper functions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Variable Hoisting with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code></h2>
        <p>Variable declarations behave differently based on how they are declared. Let's break down how hoisting works with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>.</p>

        <h3><code>var</code></h3>
        <p>Variables declared with <code>var</code> are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with <code>undefined</code>. This means you can reference them before their declaration, but they won't have their assigned value yet.</p>
        <pre><code>// Variable hoisting with var
console.log(greeting); // Output: undefined
var greeting = "Hello!";
console.log(greeting); // Output: "Hello!"
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, <code>greeting</code> is hoisted but initialized with <code>undefined</code> until the assignment happens.</p>

        <h3><code>let</code> and <code>const</code></h3>
        <p>Variables declared with <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. Instead, they are placed in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ), which means you cannot use them until they are initialized.</p>
        <pre><code>// Variable hoisting with let
console.log(name); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'name' before initialization
let name = "Alice";

// Variable hoisting with const
console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
const age = 25;
</code></pre>
        <p>Both <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> prevent variables from being accessed before they are declared and initialized. This helps avoid bugs that might occur from using variables too early.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Do <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> Behave Differently?</h2>
        <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Think of <code>var</code> like a surprise guest who is announced at the beginning but doesn't show up until later. <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>, on the other hand, are more like guests who have strict entry rules. They won't let you interact with them until they've officially arrived (initialized).</p>
        <p>The difference in behavior exists to help developers write more predictable and error-free code. The temporal dead zone (TDZ) for <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> ensures that variables are not used before they are ready.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Real-World Example of Variable Hoisting</h2>
        <p>Here's an example of how variable hoisting can affect your code:</p>
        <pre><code>// Example of hoisting with var
console.log(message); // Output: undefined
var message = "This is hoisted!";

// Example of hoisting with let
console.log(counter); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'counter' before initialization
let counter = 10;
</code></pre>
        <p>In the first example, <code>var message</code> is hoisted, but initialized with <code>undefined</code>, which can lead to confusion. In the second example, <code>let counter</code> is in the temporal dead zone, which prevents it from being accessed before initialization.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Avoiding Hoisting Bugs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>:</strong> These provide more predictable behavior and help avoid unintentional hoisting issues. Reserve <code>var</code> for specific cases where its behavior is needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Declare variables at the top of their scope:</strong> This makes your code more readable and avoids confusion about where variables are hoisted.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid relying on hoisting:</strong> While hoisting can be convenient, relying on it can lead to hard-to-find bugs, especially in larger codebases.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Usage in Everyday Code</h2>
        <p>Understanding hoisting is crucial for debugging JavaScript code. Here are some real-world examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Calls:</strong> When working with asynchronous code, hoisting can cause unexpected behavior if variables are not declared properly.</li>
            <li><strong>Scope Management:</strong> Hoisting affects how variables are scoped, so knowing the hoisting behavior can help prevent scoping issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Organization:</strong> Understanding function hoisting allows you to organize code where higher-level logic can appear before helper functions, improving readability.</li>
        </ul>
