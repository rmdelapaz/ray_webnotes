        <h2>Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript can handle both synchronous and asynchronous code. While synchronous code executes line by line, asynchronous code allows certain tasks to happen in the background without blocking the main thread. This means you can handle tasks like network requests, file reading, and timeouts without making the user wait.</p>

        <h2>What is Asynchronous Code?</h2>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine you're at a restaurant, and you order food. The waiter takes your order and continues to serve other customers while the kitchen prepares your meal. You don't have to wait idly at the counter; instead, you continue chatting or working. When the food is ready, the waiter brings it to your table (callback). This is similar to how asynchronous code worksâ€”certain tasks happen "in the background," and once they're done, the callback is executed.</p>

        <h2>Why Asynchronous JavaScript Matters</h2>
        <p>Asynchronous programming is essential for building fast, responsive applications. When you interact with APIs, fetch data from servers, or perform time-consuming tasks, asynchronous JavaScript prevents your program from freezing while waiting for those tasks to complete.</p>
        <p>For example, imagine you're fetching data from a remote server. If JavaScript executed this synchronously, the user interface would freeze until the data was fully fetched. Instead, with asynchronous code, you can fetch the data while allowing the user to continue interacting with the application.</p>

        <h2>How to Write Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript provides multiple ways to write asynchronous code, including <code>callbacks</code>, <code>promises</code>, and the modern <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>1. Callbacks</h3>
        <p>A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, and it is executed once the task is complete. The most common example is using <code>setTimeout()</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This message is delayed by 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// This message is delayed by 2 seconds
</code></pre>
        <p>Here, the message inside the <code>setTimeout</code> callback is printed after a 2-second delay, while the rest of the code continues to execute.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>2. Promises</h3>
        <p>Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous tasks compared to callbacks, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations. A promise represents a value that will be resolved in the future, either successfully (resolved) or with an error (rejected).</p>
        <pre><code>let fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Data fetched successfully");
    }, 2000);
});

fetchData.then((message) => {
    console.log(message);
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
});
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the promise resolves after 2 seconds with the message "Data fetched successfully". You can handle the result using <code>.then()</code> for success or <code>.catch()</code> for errors.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>3. Async/Await</h3>
        <p>The modern approach to asynchronous programming is using <code>async</code> functions and the <code>await</code> keyword. This syntax makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability.</p>
        <pre><code>async function fetchData() {
    console.log("Fetching data...");
    let response = await new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data fetched successfully");
        }, 2000);
    });
    console.log(response);
}

fetchData();

// Output:
// Fetching data...
// Data fetched successfully (after 2 seconds)
</code></pre>
        <p>The <code>await</code> keyword pauses the execution of the function until the promise is resolved, making asynchronous code easier to follow.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Real-World Example: Fetching Data from an API</h2>
        <p>Asynchronous code is essential when fetching data from an external API. Using the <code>fetch</code> API, we can send HTTP requests asynchronously without blocking the main thread.</p>
        <pre><code>async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    }
}

fetchData();
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the <code>fetch</code> API asynchronously retrieves data from an external server. The <code>await</code> keyword is used to wait for the response and convert it to JSON format.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Promises and Async/Await:</strong> These provide a cleaner, more readable way to handle asynchronous tasks compared to traditional callbacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Handle Errors Gracefully:</strong> Always include error handling in your asynchronous code using <code>.catch()</code> with promises or <code>try/catch</code> blocks with <code>async/await</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Deep Callback Nesting:</strong> Known as "callback hell," deeply nested callbacks make code harder to read and maintain. Use promises or async/await to avoid this.</li>
        </ul>
