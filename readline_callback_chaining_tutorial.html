        <h2>Introduction to User Input and Readline</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, especially in Node.js, handling user input from the command line can be achieved using the <code>readline</code> module. This module provides an interface for reading data from a readable stream like process.stdin (standard input), enabling you to interact with users through the terminal.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What is the Readline Module?</h2>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of the <code>readline</code> module as a telephone operator who takes messages from callers. Each time the caller speaks, the operator notes down the input and performs actions based on it. Similarly, the <code>readline</code> module listens to user input from the terminal and lets the program react accordingly.</p>
        <pre><code>const readline = require('readline');
const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

rl.question("What's your name? ", (answer) => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${answer}!`);
    rl.close();
});
</code></pre>
        <p>This code asks for the user's name and greets them based on their input. The <code>question()</code> method takes a prompt string and a callback function, which handles the user's response.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Callback Functions and Callback Chaining</h2>
        <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Imagine a chain of events, where each event triggers another. For example, when making a cup of tea: first, you boil the water, then you add the tea bag, and finally, you wait for the tea to steep. In programming, this flow can be represented using callbacks, where each function is called after the previous one finishes.</p>
        <p>Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the task in the original function completes. When callbacks are used within callbacks, this creates a process called "callback chaining."</p>
        <pre><code>rl.question("What's your favorite color? ", (color) => {
    console.log(`You like the color ${color}.`);
    rl.question("What's your favorite food? ", (food) => {
        console.log(`You also like eating ${food}.`);
        rl.close();
    });
});
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, one callback triggers another, allowing you to handle multiple inputs in a sequence. This process of chaining ensures each question is asked in order, only after the previous input is processed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Usage of Readline and Callback Chaining</h2>
        <p>Callback chaining is particularly useful when you need to handle multiple asynchronous operations in a specific order. For instance, you might use it to gather multiple pieces of user input:</p>
        <pre><code>rl.question("Enter your username: ", (username) => {
    console.log(`Username: ${username}`);
    rl.question("Enter your password: ", (password) => {
        console.log(`Password: ${password}`);
        rl.question("Enter your email: ", (email) => {
            console.log(`Email: ${email}`);
            rl.close();
        });
    });
});
</code></pre>
        <p>This is a basic example of how you could gather a user's login information using the <code>readline</code> module and callbacks in sequence.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Handling Asynchronous Code</h2>
        <p>Asynchronous operations, like reading user input, donâ€™t block the program from continuing. With callback chaining, you control when each task happens, ensuring the program waits for the user to finish their input before proceeding to the next step.</p>
        <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Imagine an online registration form that asks the user for their name, age, and email address. Each of these fields must be completed before the form is submitted. Similarly, using the <code>readline</code> module with callbacks, you can collect this information one piece at a time, only proceeding once the user provides an answer.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Callback Chaining</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> Avoid nesting too many callbacks, as it can make the code harder to read. Use named functions when possible to make the code cleaner.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Ensure you handle errors appropriately. If one step in the chain fails, you should gracefully exit or show the user a meaningful error message.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider Promises:</strong> For more complex asynchronous flows, promises or <code>async/await</code> might be more suitable than deep callback chains.</li>
        </ul>
