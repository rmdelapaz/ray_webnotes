            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a versatile language that can run in different environments. While many associate JavaScript with web browsers, Node.js provides a powerful, server-side environment that extends JavaScript's use beyond the browser. But what exactly makes Node.js different from browser runtimes, and why would you choose one over the other?</p>

            <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
            <p>Node.js is like a backstage crew at a theater production. While the actors (your JavaScript code) can perform on stage (the browser), Node.js provides a way for them to also work behind the scenes. It enables JavaScript to run on the server, handle files, work with databases, and interact with other back-end systems. Imagine Node.js as a different kind of stage where JavaScript gets to wear a different hat.</p>

            <h2>Key Differences Between Node.js and Browser Runtimes</h2>
            <p>Understanding the differences between Node.js and browser runtimes helps clarify when and where you might use each:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Web browsers are client-side environments, meaning they are designed to run on users' devices and manage user interactions. Node.js is a server-side environment, designed to handle tasks on the back-end, like processing data or serving web pages.</li>
                <li><strong>APIs:</strong> Browsers provide APIs for things like DOM manipulation, which allows JavaScript to change how a webpage looks. Node.js, on the other hand, provides APIs for working with the file system, network requests, and databases—things a browser doesn't need to do.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Objects:</strong> In the browser, you have <code>window</code>, <code>document</code>, and <code>navigator</code> as global objects. In Node.js, you have <code>global</code>, <code>process</code>, and <code>require</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Modules:</strong> Node.js uses CommonJS modules (e.g., <code>require</code> and <code>module.exports</code>), whereas browsers use ES modules (e.g., <code>import</code> and <code>export</code>).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Practical Usage of Node.js</h2>
            <p>Node.js is ideal when you need to build server-side applications. Here are a few examples of what you can do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web Servers:</strong> Instead of relying on Apache or Nginx, you can write your web server using Node.js. This is how many modern applications, including Express apps, are built.</li>
                <li><strong>Command Line Tools:</strong> Many developer tools are built with Node.js because it makes reading and writing files, handling user input, and creating scripts straightforward.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Applications:</strong> Node.js excels at real-time communication. Think of chat applications or collaborative tools where you need to handle many simultaneous connections.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>When and Why to Use Node.js?</h2>
            <p>Node.js is particularly useful when building applications that need to handle multiple tasks concurrently. Unlike traditional server-side languages, Node.js is non-blocking, meaning it can handle multiple requests at once without waiting for one to finish before starting another. This makes it perfect for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Applications that require real-time updates (e.g., online games, collaborative editing tools)</li>
                <li>Microservices architecture, where small, independent services communicate with each other</li>
                <li>APIs for mobile or single-page applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In contrast, if your goal is to build interactive user interfaces or web pages, you'll still rely on browser JavaScript. Node.js doesn't replace browser code—it complements it.</p>

            <h2>Code Example: Simple HTTP Server</h2>
            <p>Let’s look at a simple example of creating a basic HTTP server using Node.js:</p>
            <pre><code>
// Import the built-in HTTP module
const http = require('http');

// Create a server that sends a response
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello, World!');
});

// Listen on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
            </code></pre>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This code sets up a basic web server using Node.js. It listens on port 3000 and sends a simple "Hello, World!" message whenever someone accesses the server. Unlike a browser, where JavaScript manipulates web pages, Node.js here is handling server requests.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Real-World Example: Using Node.js for Automation</h2>
            <p>Node.js can be a handy tool for automating repetitive tasks. For example, you could use Node.js to automate data scraping, generate reports, or even deploy your code. Here’s a simple script that reads a file and prints its content:</p>
            <pre><code>
const fs = require('fs');

// Read the file content
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log(data);
});
            </code></pre>
            <p>This example demonstrates how Node.js can interact with the file system—something a browser cannot do. Imagine having to process logs or analyze data; Node.js can do this behind the scenes without user interaction.</p>

            <h2>Further Exploration</h2>
            <p>To deepen your understanding of Node.js, consider exploring the following topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using frameworks like Express.js for building web applications</li>
                <li>Understanding the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model of Node.js</li>
                <li>Learning about package management with npm (Node Package Manager)</li>
                <li>Exploring how to set up REST APIs using Node.js and Express</li>
            </ul>
