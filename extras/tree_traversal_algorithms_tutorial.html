        <h1>Understanding Tree Traversal Algorithms in JavaScript</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Tree traversal is the process of visiting all the nodes in a tree data structure. There are several ways to traverse a tree, and each method serves a different purpose. The most common tree traversal algorithms include In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, and Level-order traversal. In this tutorial, we will explore these traversal methods and their practical use cases.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Code Example: In-Order Traversal</h2>
        <p>In-order traversal visits the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. It’s commonly used for binary search trees because it visits the nodes in ascending order:</p>
        <pre><code>function inOrder(node) {
    if (node === null) return;
    inOrder(node.left);  // Visit left subtree
    console.log(node.value);  // Visit root node
    inOrder(node.right);  // Visit right subtree
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the traversal starts with the leftmost node and works its way up the tree, printing nodes in ascending order for a binary search tree.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Code Example: Pre-Order Traversal</h2>
        <p>Pre-order traversal visits the root node first, followed by the left and right subtrees. It’s useful for creating a copy of the tree or evaluating expressions stored in binary trees:</p>
        <pre><code>function preOrder(node) {
    if (node === null) return;
    console.log(node.value);  // Visit root node
    preOrder(node.left);  // Visit left subtree
    preOrder(node.right);  // Visit right subtree
}</code></pre>
        <p>Pre-order traversal visits nodes in the order they appear in the tree, starting from the root.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Code Example: Post-Order Traversal</h2>
        <p>Post-order traversal visits the left and right subtrees first, followed by the root node. It’s useful for deleting nodes or evaluating expressions in postfix notation:</p>
        <pre><code>function postOrder(node) {
    if (node === null) return;
    postOrder(node.left);  // Visit left subtree
    postOrder(node.right);  // Visit right subtree
    console.log(node.value);  // Visit root node
}</code></pre>
        <p>Post-order traversal is particularly useful when you need to delete nodes, as it ensures that child nodes are visited before their parent nodes.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Code Example: Level-Order Traversal (Breadth-First)</h2>
        <p>Level-order traversal (or breadth-first traversal) visits nodes level by level, starting from the root. It’s useful for searching trees layer by layer:</p>
        <pre><code>function levelOrder(root) {
    const queue = [root];
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const node = queue.shift();
        console.log(node.value);  // Visit current node
        if (node.left !== null) queue.push(node.left);  // Add left child to queue
        if (node.right !== null) queue.push(node.right);  // Add right child to queue
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>This method uses a queue to visit nodes level by level, which is useful for breadth-first search in a tree.</p>

        <h2>Analogy: Walking Through a Maze</h2>
        <p>Imagine you’re walking through a maze (the tree), and there are different ways to explore it. In-order traversal is like walking down the leftmost path first, then turning back to visit the middle, and finally the right side. Pre-order is like starting at the entrance and going left and right from there. Post-order is like exploring the entire maze and finishing at the starting point, and level-order is like exploring one layer of the maze at a time, starting from the top.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Real-World Example: File System Navigation</h2>
        <p>Tree traversal algorithms are widely used in file systems. When you open a folder on your computer, the operating system may use pre-order traversal to list the contents of each folder. Post-order traversal might be used when deleting a folder to ensure that all subfolders and files are deleted first before the folder itself is removed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Use Different Traversal Algorithms?</h2>
        <p>Each traversal algorithm serves a different purpose. In-order traversal is best for sorted data like binary search trees. Pre-order is useful for copying or reconstructing a tree, and post-order is used for tasks where child nodes need to be processed before their parent nodes. Level-order traversal is ideal for breadth-first searches and applications that require processing nodes at each level of the tree.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Usage</h2>
        <p>Tree traversal algorithms are used in various applications, from file system management to data structures like binary search trees, expression trees, and decision trees. Understanding these algorithms helps you efficiently navigate and manipulate hierarchical data.</p>
