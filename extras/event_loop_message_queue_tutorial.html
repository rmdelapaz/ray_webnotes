        <h2>Introduction to the Event Loop</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. However, thanks to the event loop, JavaScript is capable of handling asynchronous operations without getting blocked. In this tutorial, we'll explore how the event loop works and how it interacts with the message queue to keep your JavaScript applications running smoothly.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>What is the Event Loop?</h2>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine a chef in a busy kitchen. The chef can only cook one dish at a time (like JavaScript running on a single thread), but new orders keep coming in. The orders are placed in a queue, and the chef picks up the next order only after finishing the current task. The event loop is like that chefâ€”processing one task from the queue at a time.</p>
        <p>The event loop allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, even though it runs on a single thread. It works by continuously checking the message queue to see if there are any tasks waiting to be executed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Message Queue</h2>
        <p>The message queue is where asynchronous tasks (such as timers, network requests, or user events) are placed to be executed by the event loop. The queue holds these tasks until the event loop is ready to execute them.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you set a timer using <code>setTimeout()</code>, the timer is moved to the message queue once it expires, waiting for the event loop to finish its current task before it can execute the callback.</p>
        <pre><code>console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout finished");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Timeout finished (after 1 second)
</code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How the Event Loop Works</h2>
        <p>The event loop continuously checks two main things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The call stack: This is where synchronous code is executed, one frame at a time.</li>
            <li>The message queue: This is where asynchronous tasks wait to be executed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the call stack is empty, the event loop picks the next task from the message queue and pushes it onto the call stack, executing it. This cycle repeats indefinitely.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Example: Event Loop in Action</h2>
        <p>Let's see an example where the event loop is at work:</p>
        <pre><code>console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout finished");
}, 0);

console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Timeout finished
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, you might expect the <code>setTimeout()</code> callback to run immediately since the delay is 0. However, that's not the case. Even with a delay of 0, the <code>setTimeout()</code> callback is added to the message queue and only executed after the synchronous code has finished executing. This demonstrates how the event loop handles asynchronous tasks.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Application: Handling User Events</h2>
        <p>The event loop is crucial when dealing with user events like clicks, scrolls, or keystrokes. These events are asynchronous, and their event listeners are placed in the message queue when triggered. The event loop processes them only when the call stack is clear.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your JavaScript code is running a long loop, the UI might become unresponsive because the event loop is busy with the call stack and hasn't yet processed user events in the message queue.</p>
        <pre><code>document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
});

for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
    // Long-running loop
}
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the button click won't be processed until the loop finishes, demonstrating why understanding the event loop is crucial for responsive UI development.</p>

        <h2>Metaphor: Event Loop as a Restaurant Waiter</h2>
        <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The event loop is like a waiter in a restaurant who can only serve one table at a time. The waiter picks up an order (synchronous task) from a table, serves the food, and then goes back to check if there are any more orders in the queue. The message queue represents the list of pending orders, and the waiter (event loop) checks the queue only after finishing the current task.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Does the Event Loop Matter?</h2>
        <p>Understanding the event loop is crucial for writing non-blocking, asynchronous JavaScript code. It helps you manage tasks such as network requests, timers, and user events without freezing the entire program. Knowing how the event loop and message queue work allows you to build more efficient, responsive applications.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Asynchronous Code</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Promises and Async/Await:</strong> Promises and <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code without deeply nesting callbacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Long-Running Operations:</strong> Break long-running tasks into smaller chunks or use <code>setTimeout()</code> to allow the event loop to process other tasks in between.</li>
            <li><strong>Debouncing and Throttling:</strong> These techniques help you manage how frequently functions like event listeners are called, reducing the load on the event loop.</li>
        </ul>
