    <h2>3. Common Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
    <p>Here are some key techniques to help you tackle coding challenges:</p>
    
    <h3>Divide and Conquer</h3>
    <p>
        Break large problems into smaller, easier-to-solve pieces. 
        <strong>Example:</strong> If creating a full-featured calculator is daunting, start by implementing individual operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong> Think of it as solving a puzzle by working on one section at a time.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
    <p>
        Recognize patterns in problems you've solved before and apply the same strategies. 
        This skill comes with practice. Many problems in programming share similar solutions, such as loops, recursion, or data manipulation.
    </p>

    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
    <p>
        Build reusable components. Don't solve the same problem twice – if you encounter a repeated problem, write a reusable function or class.
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong> It's like building with Lego blocks – create reusable pieces to build larger structures.
    </p>

    <h3>Trial and Error</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes, the best way to learn is by trying different approaches and learning from your mistakes. Always test your code frequently as you build it.
        <strong>Example:</strong> Iterating over different algorithms to find the most efficient one for sorting a list of data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Debugging: A Key Part of Problem Solving</h2>
    <p>
        Debugging is a core part of problem solving. Bugs are inevitable, but learning how to identify and fix them is crucial.
    </p>

    <h3>Strategies for Debugging</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Console Logs:</strong> Inserting logs helps you track the flow of your program and see where it might be failing.</li>
            <li><strong>Read Error Messages:</strong> These are like clues the program leaves behind – they help you pinpoint where the issue occurred.</li>
            <li><strong>Test in Isolation:</strong> If something isn’t working, test small sections of your code to narrow down the problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Problem-Solving with Algorithms</h2>
    <p>
        Algorithms are at the heart of solving problems programmatically. They define how a problem should be solved step-by-step.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why Algorithms Matter</h3>
    <p>
        Algorithms determine the efficiency of your solution. A well-optimized algorithm can drastically improve the performance of your application.
        <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Google uses complex algorithms to calculate the fastest route for users in Google Maps.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong> Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort are classic examples. Sorting data efficiently is a common problem in programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Search Algorithms:</strong> Binary Search is a popular method used to quickly find elements in sorted arrays.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong> Algorithms are like the brain of a program – just like a recipe tells you how to cook, an algorithm tells the computer how to solve a problem.
    </p>
