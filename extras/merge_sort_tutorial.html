    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer strategy. It divides the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts each subarray, and then merges them back together to form the sorted array. In this tutorial, we’ll dive into how merge sort works, when it’s useful, and how to implement it efficiently.</p>

        <h2>Code Example: Merge Sort</h2>
        <p>Here’s an example of the merge sort algorithm implemented in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre><code>function mergeSort(arr) {
    if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;  // Base case
    const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
    const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
    const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));
    return merge(left, right);
}

function merge(left, right) {
    const result = [];
    let i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
        if (left[i] < right[j]) {
            result.push(left[i]);
            i++;
        } else {
            result.push(right[j]);
            j++;
        }
    }
    return result.concat(left.slice(i)).concat(right.slice(j));
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, <code>mergeSort</code> recursively splits the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the two halves together using the <code>merge</code> function.</p>

        <h2>Analogy: Sorting Puzzle Pieces</h2>
        <p>Imagine you have a pile of puzzle pieces that need to be arranged. Instead of sorting the whole pile at once, you split the pile into smaller groups, sort each group, and then combine the sorted groups back together. This process of dividing and merging is exactly how merge sort works.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Example: Sorting Emails by Date</h2>
        <p>Let’s say you have a large list of emails that you want to sort by date. Using merge sort, you would divide the list into smaller lists, sort each smaller list by date, and then merge the sorted lists back together. This approach ensures that the entire list is sorted efficiently, even if it contains a large number of emails.</p>

        <h2>Metaphor: Organizing Bookshelves</h2>
        <p>Think of merge sort like organizing bookshelves. If you have two disorganized shelves of books, you could sort each shelf individually and then merge the two shelves by comparing the books one by one and placing them in order on a new shelf. This is how merge sort handles sorting—it splits the shelves (or arrays), sorts each one, and merges them back together in order.</p>

        <h2>Why Use Merge Sort?</h2>
        <p>Merge sort is useful because it guarantees a time complexity of <code>O(n log n)</code>, making it efficient for sorting large datasets. Unlike other sorting algorithms such as quicksort, merge sort is stable, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements. It’s also a great choice for external sorting (when data doesn’t fit into memory) because it can handle large datasets by dividing them into manageable pieces.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Usage</h2>
        <p>Merge sort is commonly used in systems where stability and efficiency are important, such as sorting large files or datasets in databases. It’s also used in parallel computing because its divide-and-conquer approach allows the sorting of subarrays to be done concurrently, making it a scalable solution for large-scale sorting problems.</p>
