        <h2>Introduction to the Call Stack</h2>
        <p>The call stack is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that helps manage the execution of functions in a program. It works like a stack of books—functions are added to the top (pushed) when called and removed (popped) once they finish executing.</p>
        <p>In this tutorial, we'll explore how the call stack works, why it’s essential, and how to troubleshoot common issues like stack overflow errors.</p>

        <h2>What is a Call Stack?</h2>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of the call stack like a stack of plates in a cafeteria. When a new plate (function) is added, it’s placed on top of the stack. When a plate is removed (function finishes), it's taken from the top. The stack follows a "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) order, meaning the last function called is the first one to finish and exit the stack.</p>
        <p>JavaScript uses a single call stack to manage the execution of all functions. When a function is called, it is added to the stack, and when it returns, it's removed from the stack.</p>

        <h2>How the Call Stack Works</h2>
        <p>Here’s a simple example of how the call stack operates in JavaScript:</p>
        <pre><code>function greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
}

function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log("Goodbye");
}

function conversation() {
    greet();
    sayGoodbye();
}

conversation();

// Output:
// Hello
// Goodbye
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the following steps occur:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>conversation()</code> is added to the call stack.</li>
            <li><code>greet()</code> is called inside <code>conversation()</code> and is added to the stack.</li>
            <li><code>greet()</code> completes and is removed from the stack.</li>
            <li><code>sayGoodbye()</code> is called and added to the stack.</li>
            <li><code>sayGoodbye()</code> completes and is removed from the stack.</li>
            <li><code>conversation()</code> completes and is removed from the stack.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding Stack Overflow</h2>
        <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Imagine piling plates on top of each other in a kitchen. If the stack becomes too tall and you keep adding plates without removing them, the stack eventually topples over. Similarly, in programming, if functions keep getting added to the call stack without finishing, it leads to a stack overflow.</p>
        <pre><code>function recursiveFunction() {
    recursiveFunction(); // The function calls itself
}

recursiveFunction(); // This will cause a stack overflow error
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the function <code>recursiveFunction()</code> calls itself infinitely, causing the call stack to overflow, leading to a stack overflow error.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Call Stack in Asynchronous Code</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time. However, with asynchronous code (like <code>setTimeout</code>), tasks can be delayed and placed in a queue for later execution without blocking the call stack.</p>
        <pre><code>console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Async operation finished");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Async operation finished (after 1 second)
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, <code>setTimeout()</code> does not block the call stack. Instead, it moves to the event loop while the rest of the code continues executing. After the delay, the callback function is added to the stack and executed.</p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Managing the Call Stack</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Break Long-Running Functions:</strong> If a function takes too long to execute, it can block the call stack. Break long tasks into smaller chunks to avoid freezing the application.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Recursive Functions Without Exit Conditions:</strong> Ensure recursive functions have base cases to prevent infinite recursion and stack overflow errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Asynchronous Code for Time-Consuming Tasks:</strong> Use <code>setTimeout</code>, <code>setInterval</code>, or promises to handle long tasks without blocking the stack.</li>
        </ul>
