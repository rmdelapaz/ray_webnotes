    <h1>Understanding Selection Sort in JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
      In this tutorial, we'll dive into another fundamental sorting algorithm:
      <strong>Selection Sort</strong>. Like Bubble Sort, it's often used to
      teach the basics of sorting algorithms due to its simplicity. We will
      break down the algorithm step by step to ensure clarity for new
      developers.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Selection Sort?</h2>
    <p>
      Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the smallest element from the
      unsorted portion of the array and placing it in its correct position.
      Think of it like sorting a stack of papers: you look through the pile,
      find the smallest piece, and put it at the top. You repeat this process
      until the entire pile is sorted.
    </p>

    <h2>When and Why to Use Selection Sort?</h2>
    <p>
      Selection Sort is often used for educational purposes because it is easy
      to understand and implement. However, like Bubble Sort, its time
      complexity is O(n^2), making it inefficient for large datasets. In
      real-world applications, we tend to use faster algorithms such as Merge
      Sort or Quick Sort, but for small datasets or where simplicity is key,
      Selection Sort works just fine.
    </p>

    <h2>Selection Sort Code Example</h2>
    <pre>
        <code>
let arr = [5, 2, 7, 1, 0];

function selectionSort(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        let minIndex = i;
        for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) minIndex = j;
        }
        let temp = arr[minIndex];
        arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = temp;
    }
    return arr;
}

console.log("Before sorting: ", arr);
console.log("After sorting: ", selectionSort(arr));        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Code Explanation</h2>

    <p>Let's walk through the code line by line:</p>

    <h3>1. Initial Array Setup</h3>
    <p>The array we want to sort is defined as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>let arr = [5, 2, 7, 1, 0];</code></pre>
    <p>
      Our goal is to sort this array in ascending order, from smallest to
      largest.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The Outer Loop</h3>
    <p>
      The outer loop determines the position of the sorted portion of the array:
    </p>
    <pre><code>for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {</code></pre>
    <p>
      Each time through this loop, we move the smallest unsorted element to its
      correct position in the sorted portion of the array. The loop runs
      <code>arr.length - 1</code> times because we don't need to compare the
      last element.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Finding the Minimum Element</h3>
    <p>
      Within the outer loop, we use an inner loop to find the smallest element
      in the unsorted portion of the array:
    </p>
    <pre><code>let minIndex = i;</code></pre>
    <p>
      This line initializes <code>minIndex</code> to the current index
      <code>i</code>, assuming the first unsorted element is the smallest.
    </p>
    <pre><code>for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
    if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) minIndex = j;
    }</code></pre>
    <p>
      Here, we compare each remaining unsorted element (<code>arr[j]</code>) to
      the current minimum (<code>arr[minIndex]</code>). If a smaller element is
      found, we update <code>minIndex</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Swapping Elements</h3>
    <p>
      After finding the smallest element, we swap it with the first unsorted
      element (<code>arr[i]</code>):
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    let temp = arr[minIndex];
    arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
    arr[i] = temp;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This ensures that the smallest element is placed in its correct sorted
      position.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Returning the Sorted Array</h3>
    <p>
      After sorting the entire array, the function returns the sorted array:
    </p>
    <pre><code>return arr;</code></pre>
    <p>
      For our example, <code>arr</code> starts as
      <code>[5, 2, 7, 1, 0]</code> and is sorted into
      <code>[0, 1, 2, 5, 7]</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Real-World Example and Applications</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine sorting books on a shelf by height. You start by looking for the
      smallest book, take it out, and place it in the first position. Then, you
      look for the next smallest book, and so on. This is similar to how
      Selection Sort works.
    </p>

    <h2>Further Exploration</h2>
    <p>
      Once you're comfortable with Selection Sort, you can explore more
      efficient sorting algorithms such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Insertion Sort</li>
      <li>Merge Sort</li>
      <li>Quick Sort</li>
      <li>Heap Sort</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Selection Sort is a simple and intuitive algorithm that helps introduce
      the concept of sorting. While it's not the most efficient for large
      datasets, it's a good starting point for understanding how sorting
      algorithms work.
