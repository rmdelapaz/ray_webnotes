        <h2>Introduction to Timeouts and Intervals</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, time-based functions like <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> allow you to schedule code execution after a certain delay or repeatedly at specific intervals. These functions are crucial for handling tasks like animation, polling, or timing actions in applications.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What is <code>setTimeout</code>?</h2>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of <code>setTimeout</code> as an alarm clock. You set it to go off after a specific amount of time, and when it rings, it executes a task (callback). Once the task is complete, the timer is done, and it wonâ€™t repeat.</p>
        <pre><code>setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This message appears after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
</code></pre>
        <p>This example waits for 2 seconds before printing the message.</p>
        <p><code>setTimeout</code> is useful when you need to delay the execution of a function by a certain amount of time. It is often used for tasks like animations, loading screens, or delaying a process.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What is <code>setInterval</code>?</h2>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> While <code>setTimeout</code> is like an alarm clock that goes off once, <code>setInterval</code> is like a recurring alarm. It will keep ringing every set interval of time until you stop it manually.</p>
        <pre><code>let count = 0;
const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    count++;
    console.log("Interval:", count);
    if (count === 5) {
        clearInterval(intervalId);
        console.log("Interval cleared");
    }
}, 1000);
</code></pre>
        <p>This code prints "Interval: 1", "Interval: 2", etc., every second. After 5 seconds, the interval is cleared.</p>
        <p><code>setInterval</code> is useful when you want to execute a task repeatedly at fixed intervals, such as checking the status of a task or creating animations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Uses of Timeouts and Intervals</h2>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Animating elements on a webpage. You can use <code>setInterval</code> to animate the movement of an object by updating its position every few milliseconds:</p>
        <pre><code>let position = 0;
const box = document.getElementById("box");

const moveBox = setInterval(() => {
    position += 5;
    box.style.left = position + "px";
    if (position >= 200) {
        clearInterval(moveBox);
    }
}, 100);
</code></pre>
        <p>This moves a box element to the right by 5 pixels every 100 milliseconds, and the movement stops once it reaches 200 pixels.</p>

        <h2>Using Timeouts and Intervals in Real-World Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Polling:</strong> You can use <code>setInterval</code> to poll a server for new data periodically, such as fetching live updates from an API.</li>
            <li><strong>Loading Indicators:</strong> Use <code>setTimeout</code> to delay the display of a loading indicator when fetching data from a server.</li>
            <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Time-based functions are frequently used in JavaScript to create animations, such as sliders, progress bars, or moving elements on a webpage.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Clearing Timeouts and Intervals</h2>
        <p>It's important to clear intervals and timeouts when they are no longer needed, especially if they affect performance or cause memory leaks.</p>
        <p><code>clearTimeout(timeoutId)</code> and <code>clearInterval(intervalId)</code> are used to stop the execution of timeouts and intervals:</p>
        <pre><code>let timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This won't run because it's cleared");
}, 5000);

clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Stops the timeout before it executes
</code></pre>
