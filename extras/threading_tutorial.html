        <h2>Introduction to Threading</h2>
        <p>Threading is a powerful concept in programming that allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within a program. Threads can run separately from each other, allowing a program to perform tasks like downloading a file and responding to user input simultaneously.</p>
        <p>This tutorial explores what threading is, why it’s useful, and how it’s implemented in programming languages.</p>

        <h2>What is a Thread?</h2>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine a restaurant with multiple chefs. Each chef (thread) can prepare different dishes at the same time, allowing the kitchen to complete multiple orders more efficiently. Similarly, threads allow programs to handle multiple tasks at once, like responding to users while processing background tasks.</p>
        <p>A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a program. It shares the same memory space with other threads in the same process, but it can run independently, often performing different tasks simultaneously.</p>

        <h2>Single vs. Multi-Threading</h2>
        <p><strong>Single-threaded:</strong> In a single-threaded program, tasks are executed one after another. If one task takes a long time, it blocks the rest of the program from continuing.</p>
        <pre><code>// Single-threaded example in JavaScript
console.log("Task 1");
console.log("Task 2");
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Multi-threaded:</strong> In a multi-threaded program, multiple tasks can run concurrently, allowing more efficient use of CPU resources.</p>
        <pre><code>// Pseudo multi-threading example (conceptual, not JavaScript)
Thread 1: "Downloading file"
Thread 2: "Responding to user input"
</code></pre>
    </section>

        <h2>Why Use Threading?</h2>
        <p>Threading improves the efficiency and responsiveness of applications. Here are some key benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Threads allow a program to handle multiple tasks concurrently, like processing user input while performing background computations.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Multi-threading makes better use of the CPU by ensuring it’s not idle while waiting for tasks like file I/O or network responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Threads help applications remain responsive to users, even when they are performing resource-intensive operations.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Use of Threads in Programming</h2>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine a web server that handles multiple users. Each user request can be handled by a separate thread, allowing the server to process many requests simultaneously without blocking other users.</p>
        <pre><code>// Python example using threading
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(i)

def print_letters():
    for letter in ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']:
        print(letter)

# Create two threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

# Start the threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for both threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
</code></pre>
        <p>In this Python example, the <code>print_numbers</code> and <code>print_letters</code> functions run in parallel using threads, printing numbers and letters simultaneously.</p>

        <h2>Challenges of Multi-Threading</h2>
        <p>While threading provides many advantages, it also introduces challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Race Conditions:</strong> Occurs when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable results.</li>
            <li><strong>Deadlocks:</strong> A situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for resources held by the other.</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Multi-threaded programs can be harder to debug and maintain due to the unpredictable interactions between threads.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Best Practices for Threading</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Thread Pools:</strong> Thread pools manage a pool of worker threads, helping reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads frequently.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimize Shared Resources:</strong> Avoid sharing data between threads to reduce the risk of race conditions. If necessary, use locks or other synchronization mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Test for Race Conditions:</strong> Ensure your program handles shared data properly by testing for race conditions and using synchronization techniques like mutexes or semaphores.</li>
        </ul>
