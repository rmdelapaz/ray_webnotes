        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In software development, writing clean, readable, and maintainable code is crucial for long-term success. It's not just about making the code work, but also about ensuring it can be easily understood, improved, and extended in the future.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Clean Code: What Does It Mean?</h2>
        <p>Clean code is like a well-organized kitchen—everything is where it should be, and anyone who walks in can easily start cooking. Similarly, clean code is well-organized, follows consistent conventions, and avoids clutter.</p>

        <h3>Principles of Clean Code:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meaningful Names:</strong> Variables, functions, and classes should have names that describe their purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Small Functions:</strong> Functions should do one thing and do it well. Avoid large, complex functions.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Comments:</strong> Instead of relying on comments to explain your code, make the code itself self-explanatory through clear naming and structure.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Readable Code: Easier to Understand</h2>
        <p>Readable code allows other developers (or even your future self) to quickly understand the logic. Think of it as writing a story that others can follow without needing extensive explanations.</p>

        <h3>Example of Unreadable Code:</h3>
        <pre><code>// Unreadable code
let x = 10, y = 20, z = 30;
if (x + y === z && y - x === 10) {
    console.log("Success");
}
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Readable Code Version:</h3>
        <pre><code>// Readable code
let firstNumber = 10;
let secondNumber = 20;
let result = 30;

if (firstNumber + secondNumber === result && secondNumber - firstNumber === 10) {
    console.log("Calculation is successful");
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>Readable code uses descriptive variable names and simplifies complex expressions, making it easier to follow the logic.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Maintainable Code: Building for the Future</h2>
        <p>Maintainable code is code that can be updated, improved, or fixed without introducing new bugs or breaking existing functionality. Think of it like maintaining a car—regular care and organization prevent bigger problems down the road.</p>

        <h3>Key Practices for Maintainability:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Break down your code into smaller, reusable modules or components.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Style:</strong> Follow consistent code formatting and naming conventions across the codebase.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Write tests to ensure that your code works as expected and continues to do so after changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example of Modular Code:</h3>
        <pre><code>// Non-modular code
function calculateCircleArea(radius) {
    return 3.14 * radius * radius;
}

function calculateSquareArea(side) {
    return side * side;
}

// Modular Code
function calculateArea(shape, dimension) {
    if (shape === 'circle') {
        return 3.14 * dimension * dimension;
    } else if (shape === 'square') {
        return dimension * dimension;
    }
}
        </code></pre>
    </section>

        <h2>Best Practices for Writing Maintainable Code</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Refactor Regularly:</strong> Continuously improve your code. If you notice repetitive or complex logic, simplify it.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow Design Patterns:</strong> Use common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, or Observer to organize your code efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Write Tests:</strong> Maintainable code is tested code. Unit tests and integration tests ensure that your changes don’t introduce bugs.</li>
            <li><strong>Review and Document:</strong> Conduct code reviews with your team and ensure documentation for critical parts of the code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Usage and Real-World Example</h2>
        <p>Consider a team building a large e-commerce platform. Clean, readable, and maintainable code allows multiple developers to work on different parts of the system, from user authentication to product management. By following these principles, team members can contribute without stepping on each other's toes, and the codebase remains adaptable to new features and improvements.</p>
