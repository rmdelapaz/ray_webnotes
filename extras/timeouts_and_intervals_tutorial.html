        <h2>Introduction to Timeouts and Intervals</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, timeouts and intervals are critical for handling delayed or repeated tasks. They allow you to schedule code execution at specific times, adding dynamic behavior to your applications.</p>
        <p>Think of timeouts and intervals like timers in a kitchen. A <strong>timeout</strong> is like setting a timer to cook something for a specific time. Once the timer goes off, you take action. An <strong>interval</strong> is like a kitchen timer that rings every few minutes to remind you to check your cooking progress.</p>

        <h2>1. Timeouts: One-Time Delays</h2>
        <p><strong>setTimeout()</strong> is used to execute a function after a specified delay. It's like setting a countdown timer: the function runs once the timer reaches zero.</p>

        <h3>Real-World Analogy:</h3>
        <p>Imagine you put a pizza in the oven and set a timer for 10 minutes. Once the timer goes off, you take the pizza out. That’s how <code>setTimeout()</code> works—after a certain amount of time, the code executes.</p>

        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre><code>
// Example of setTimeout
console.log("Pizza is in the oven.");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Pizza is ready!");
}, 10000);  // Wait 10 seconds before printing
        </code></pre>

        <p>In this case, after 10 seconds (or 10,000 milliseconds), the message "Pizza is ready!" is printed.</p>

        <h3>When to Use Timeouts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating delays in animation sequences.</li>
            <li>Simulating loading screens or network requests.</li>
            <li>Waiting a certain amount of time before performing an action (e.g., pop-up notifications).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Intervals: Repeating Actions</h2>
        <p><strong>setInterval()</strong> is used to repeatedly execute a function at a specified interval. It’s like setting a reminder that goes off every 5 minutes, prompting you to check something regularly.</p>

        <h3>Real-World Analogy:</h3>
        <p>Think of a fitness app that reminds you to stand up every hour. The reminder repeats itself every hour until you stop it, just like how <code>setInterval()</code> works to repeat an action over time.</p>

        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre><code>
// Example of setInterval
let seconds = 0;

let timer = setInterval(() => {
    seconds += 1;
    console.log(`Elapsed time: ${seconds} seconds`);
}, 1000);  // Runs every second

// Use clearInterval(timer) to stop the timer
        </code></pre>

        <p>In this example, the timer increments every second, continuously printing the elapsed time.</p>

        <h3>When to Use Intervals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Updating a clock or timer in real-time.</li>
            <li>Polling a server for updated data at regular intervals.</li>
            <li>Creating repeated visual or sound effects (e.g., blinking notifications).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Managing Timeouts and Intervals</h2>
        <p>Both <code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code> can be managed with their respective clear functions: <code>clearTimeout()</code> and <code>clearInterval()</code>. These are like hitting the "stop" button on your timer or reminder.</p>

        <h4>Example: Clearing a Timeout</h4>
        <pre><code>
// Setting a timeout but clearing it before it executes
let timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This will never be printed.");
}, 5000);

clearTimeout(timeoutId);  // Timeout is cleared before it can run
        </code></pre>

        <h4>Example: Clearing an Interval</h4>
        <pre><code>
// Example of clearing an interval after 5 seconds
let count = 0;

let intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    count += 1;
    console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
    
    if (count >= 5) {
        clearInterval(intervalId);
        console.log("Interval cleared.");
    }
}, 1000);
        </code></pre>

        <p>In this case, the interval will run 5 times, then stop itself by calling <code>clearInterval()</code>.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>4. Practical Applications in Real-World Development</h2>
        <p>Timeouts and intervals are widely used in modern web development for tasks like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-time updates:</strong> Displaying real-time data from a server, like stock prices or live sports scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduling UI changes:</strong> Creating user interface animations that occur after a short delay (e.g., showing a tooltip after hovering over an element).</li>
            <li><strong>Reminders and Notifications:</strong> Showing reminders or notifications that appear periodically (e.g., health apps reminding you to stand up).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By mastering timeouts and intervals, you can control when and how often code runs, adding a new layer of interactivity to your applications. Whether you're building animations, reminders, or real-time applications, these tools will play a key role in your JavaScript toolkit!</p>
