    <h1>Problem Solving for New Developers</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this lecture aimed at helping new developers master the art of problem-solving through a structured approach, relatable examples, and practical strategies.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction to Problem Solving</h2>
    <p>
        Problem solving is a critical skill for developers. It is not just about writing code but also about thinking logically and strategically. Think of problem-solving like being a detective – you gather clues (requirements), analyze the evidence (code), and figure out the best solution (fix or implementation).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Real-World Examples:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Debugging a program to fix a bug that causes the app to crash</li>
            <li>Improving the performance of an app to handle more users efficiently</li>
            <li>Designing a new feature for a web application</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>2. George Polya’s 4-Step Problem-Solving Method</h2>
    <p>This method is a tried-and-true way to approach any problem, especially when coding.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Understand the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Start by making sure you fully understand the problem. Break it down into smaller, manageable pieces. 
        <strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you're asked to build a function that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart, including discounts and taxes. 
        What information do you need? What are the edge cases?
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Devise a Plan</h3>
    <p>
        Now that you understand the problem, create a plan. 
        <strong>Example:</strong> Write pseudocode or create a flowchart. Identify which functions or methods you’ll need. 
        Planning is like creating a roadmap for a road trip – you figure out which routes (functions) you’ll take and anticipate potential roadblocks (bugs).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Execute the Plan</h3>
    <p>
        Begin coding based on your plan. Start by building and testing small pieces of the solution. 
        Think of it as following a recipe – step by step, you work through the ingredients (code) to create a finished dish (program).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Review and Reflect</h3>
    <p>
        Once the code is running, test it thoroughly. Consider why the code works (or doesn’t). This reflection helps you improve not only your current solution but also your problem-solving skills in general.
        <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Debugging a complex data algorithm to handle large data sets more efficiently.
