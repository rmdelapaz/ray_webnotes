        <h1>Understanding Tail Recursion in JavaScript</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Tail recursion is a specific form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. This technique allows for certain optimizations that reduce the memory overhead associated with recursion. In this tutorial, we will explore how tail recursion works, when to use it, and how it can help prevent stack overflow for deep recursive calls.</p>

        <h2>Code Example: Tail-Recursive Factorial</h2>
        <p>Here’s an example of a tail-recursive factorial function, which accumulates the result in an additional argument and returns it once the base case is reached:</p>
        <pre><code>function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
    if (n === 0) return acc;  // Base case
    return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);  // Tail recursive call
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this version, the recursive call is the last action performed, which enables certain optimizations by the JavaScript engine, preventing stack overflow for large values of <code>n</code>.</p>

        <h2>Analogy: Passing the Baton</h2>
        <p>Imagine a relay race where each runner passes the baton to the next. In tail recursion, instead of keeping track of every runner and their time (like in regular recursion), the last runner holds all the accumulated times in the baton and simply passes it forward until the race is done. This is why tail recursion is efficient—it doesn’t need to remember all the previous states.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Example: Summing Numbers</h2>
        <p>Let’s say you want to sum all the numbers from 1 to <code>n</code>. A tail-recursive function can be used to accumulate the sum:</p>
        <pre><code>function sum(n, acc = 0) {
    if (n === 0) return acc;  // Base case
    return sum(n - 1, n + acc);  // Tail recursive call
}</code></pre>
        <p>This avoids the need to keep track of every intermediate sum, reducing the memory footprint and making the function more efficient for large values of <code>n</code>.</p>

        <h2>Metaphor: Climbing a Staircase</h2>
        <p>Think of tail recursion like climbing a staircase where each step is a recursive call. In regular recursion, you carry every step with you, which makes the journey harder. In tail recursion, you only remember the current step, which makes the climb more manageable and efficient, especially when you have many steps (or recursive calls).</p>

        <h2>Why Use Tail Recursion?</h2>
        <p>Tail recursion is especially useful in scenarios where deep recursion is required, such as computing large factorials or processing long lists. Since the recursive call is the last operation, it allows for tail-call optimization (TCO), which minimizes the memory overhead and avoids stack overflow. While JavaScript engines like V8 currently don’t fully support TCO, the concept is still valuable and supported in other languages like Scheme or Python.</p>

        <h2>Practical Usage</h2>
        <p>Tail recursion is frequently used in functional programming languages and recursive algorithms that require deep recursion, such as tree traversal, list processing, and mathematical computations. By using tail recursion, you can write clean, recursive code while avoiding the common pitfalls of stack overflow.</p>
