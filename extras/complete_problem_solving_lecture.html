    <h1>Problem Solving for New Developers</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this lecture aimed at helping new developers master the art of problem-solving through a structured approach, relatable examples, and practical strategies.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction to Problem Solving</h2>
    <p>
        Problem solving is a critical skill for developers. It is not just about writing code but also about thinking logically and strategically. Think of problem-solving like being a detective – you gather clues (requirements), analyze the evidence (code), and figure out the best solution (fix or implementation).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Real-World Examples:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Debugging a program to fix a bug that causes the app to crash</li>
            <li>Improving the performance of an app to handle more users efficiently</li>
            <li>Designing a new feature for a web application</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>2. George Polya’s 4-Step Problem-Solving Method</h2>
    <p>This method is a tried-and-true way to approach any problem, especially when coding.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Understand the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Start by making sure you fully understand the problem. Break it down into smaller, manageable pieces. 
        <strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you're asked to build a function that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart, including discounts and taxes. 
        What information do you need? What are the edge cases?
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Devise a Plan</h3>
    <p>
        Now that you understand the problem, create a plan. 
        <strong>Example:</strong> Write pseudocode or create a flowchart. Identify which functions or methods you’ll need. 
        Planning is like creating a roadmap for a road trip – you figure out which routes (functions) you’ll take and anticipate potential roadblocks (bugs).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Execute the Plan</h3>
    <p>
        Begin coding based on your plan. Start by building and testing small pieces of the solution. 
        Think of it as following a recipe – step by step, you work through the ingredients (code) to create a finished dish (program).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Review and Reflect</h3>
    <p>
        Once the code is running, test it thoroughly. Consider why the code works (or doesn’t). This reflection helps you improve not only your current solution but also your problem-solving skills in general.
        <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Debugging a complex data algorithm to handle large data sets more efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Common Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
    <p>Here are some key techniques to help you tackle coding challenges:</p>
    
    <h3>Divide and Conquer</h3>
    <p>
        Break large problems into smaller, easier-to-solve pieces. 
        <strong>Example:</strong> If creating a full-featured calculator is daunting, start by implementing individual operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong> Think of it as solving a puzzle by working on one section at a time.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
    <p>
        Recognize patterns in problems you've solved before and apply the same strategies. 
        This skill comes with practice. Many problems in programming share similar solutions, such as loops, recursion, or data manipulation.
    </p>

    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
    <p>
        Build reusable components. Don't solve the same problem twice – if you encounter a repeated problem, write a reusable function or class.
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong> It's like building with Lego blocks – create reusable pieces to build larger structures.
    </p>

    <h3>Trial and Error</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes, the best way to learn is by trying different approaches and learning from your mistakes. Always test your code frequently as you build it.
        <strong>Example:</strong> Iterating over different algorithms to find the most efficient one for sorting a list of data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Debugging: A Key Part of Problem Solving</h2>
    <p>
        Debugging is a core part of problem solving. Bugs are inevitable, but learning how to identify and fix them is crucial.
    </p>

    <h3>Strategies for Debugging</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Console Logs:</strong> Inserting logs helps you track the flow of your program and see where it might be failing.</li>
            <li><strong>Read Error Messages:</strong> These are like clues the program leaves behind – they help you pinpoint where the issue occurred.</li>
            <li><strong>Test in Isolation:</strong> If something isn’t working, test small sections of your code to narrow down the problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>5. Problem-Solving with Algorithms</h2>
    <p>
        Algorithms are at the heart of solving problems programmatically. They define how a problem should be solved step-by-step.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why Algorithms Matter</h3>
    <p>
        Algorithms determine the efficiency of your solution. A well-optimized algorithm can drastically improve the performance of your application.
        <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Google uses complex algorithms to calculate the fastest route for users in Google Maps.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong> Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort are classic examples. Sorting data efficiently is a common problem in programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Search Algorithms:</strong> Binary Search is a popular method used to quickly find elements in sorted arrays.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong> Algorithms are like the brain of a program – just like a recipe tells you how to cook, an algorithm tells the computer how to solve a problem.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Problem-Solving in a Team Environment</h2>
    <p>Solving problems in a collaborative environment introduces additional factors to consider.</p>

    <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
    <p>
        Two minds are better than one. One person codes while the other observes and reviews the approach. This dynamic can help catch mistakes early on.
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong> Think of it as having a co-pilot while flying – two people working together to ensure the flight (or code) is successful.
    </p>

    <h3>Code Reviews</h3>
    <p>
        Regular code reviews improve the quality of your code and help you learn from others. It’s like having someone proofread your essay – they can spot issues you may have missed.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Mindset and Attitude in Problem Solving</h2>
    <p>Your mindset plays a crucial role in how effectively you solve problems.</p>

    <h3>Perseverance</h3>
    <p>
        Coding often involves dealing with frustrating problems. Staying patient and persevering through challenges is key to success.
        <strong>Metaphor:</strong> Think of coding like sculpting – you chip away piece by piece until the final form emerges.
    </p>

    <h3>Embracing Failure</h3>
    <p>
        Failure is a part of the learning process. Don’t be discouraged by mistakes; instead, learn from them.
        <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> The "Fail Whale" of Twitter shows how even big companies face failure, but each mistake helps them grow.
    </p>

    <h3>Creative Problem Solving</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes, the best solutions are the ones that think outside the box. For example, using recursion to solve complex nested problems in a concise way.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Practical Problem-Solving Exercise</h2>
    <p>Let’s apply these problem-solving strategies with a live coding example.</p>

    <h3>Live Example</h3>
    <p>
        Create a function that returns all prime numbers up to a given number. What’s the most efficient way to do this? Test your function with various inputs and consider the time complexity of your solution.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Problem solving is a skill that improves with practice. By applying structured methods like Polya’s steps, utilizing key techniques, and maintaining the right mindset, developers can approach problems systematically and efficiently.
