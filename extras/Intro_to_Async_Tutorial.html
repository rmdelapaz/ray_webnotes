        <h2>Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Asynchronous JavaScript is a key concept that every modern JavaScript developer must understand. JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. But, in a world where we need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously—like fetching data from a server while maintaining a responsive user interface—we rely on asynchronous programming.</p>
        <p>Asynchronous programming allows your code to start tasks and then continue with other tasks while waiting for responses, without blocking the main thread. Let's explore key concepts in asynchronous JavaScript, with analogies, real-world examples, and when to use them!</p>

        <h2>1. Callbacks</h2>
        <p>A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then executed after the first function completes. Think of it like ordering a pizza: you place your order and go about your day. When the pizza is ready, the delivery driver (callback) brings it to your door.</p>
        
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre><code>
// Function with a callback
function makePizza(callback) {
    console.log("Pizza is being made...");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Pizza is ready!");
        callback();
    }, 2000);
}

function deliverPizza() {
    console.log("Pizza has been delivered!");
}

makePizza(deliverPizza); // You call makePizza and pass in deliverPizza as the callback
        </code></pre>
        
        <p><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> Callbacks are often used in event handling or when performing tasks like reading files or sending network requests.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Promises</h2>
        <p>A promise is like a contract. Imagine your friend promises to bring you a book. There are only three possible outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pending:</strong> Your friend is still deciding.</li>
            <li><strong>Fulfilled:</strong> Your friend gives you the book.</li>
            <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> Your friend decides not to bring the book.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Promises help you manage asynchronous operations in a clean and predictable way. Instead of chaining callbacks (which can get messy), you can use promises to manage actions that happen later.</p>
        
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre><code>
// A simple promise
let fetchBook = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let bookAvailable = true;
    
    if (bookAvailable) {
        resolve("Here's your book!");
    } else {
        reject("Sorry, no books available.");
    }
});

// Handling the promise
fetchBook
    .then(result => console.log(result))  // if resolved
    .catch(error => console.log(error));  // if rejected
        </code></pre>
        
        <p><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> Promises are commonly used when making API requests, such as fetching data from a server. The `fetch()` API in JavaScript is built on promises.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>3. Async and Await</h2>
        <p>If promises are like contracts, <strong>async</strong> and <strong>await</strong> are like a more user-friendly version of that contract. Think of it as making an order at a restaurant. While you're waiting for your food (the asynchronous operation), you can still enjoy the company of your friends (the rest of your program). When your food arrives, you "await" the completion and continue your meal.</p>
        <p><code>async</code> functions allow you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. The <code>await</code> keyword pauses the function execution until the promise is resolved.</p>
        
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre><code>
// Using async and await
async function orderPizza() {
    console.log("Ordering pizza...");
    
    let pizza = await makePizza();  // waits for the promise to resolve
    console.log(pizza);
}

orderPizza();

function makePizza() {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("Pizza is ready!"), 2000);
    });
}
        </code></pre>
        
        <p><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> Async/await is especially useful for simplifying the code when you're dealing with multiple asynchronous operations, like when loading data, handling user input, or performing complex workflows.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Event Loop</h2>
        <p>The event loop is like a restaurant manager that keeps track of all customer orders (asynchronous operations). If you're waiting for food, the manager doesn't stop the whole restaurant for you. Instead, they keep checking if your order is ready and serve it to you while continuing to handle other customers.</p>
        <p>The event loop ensures that JavaScript continues running even while it waits for asynchronous operations to complete, allowing for non-blocking code.</p>
        
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre><code>
// Example of how JavaScript handles asynchronous code
console.log("First");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Second (after delay)");
}, 1000);

console.log("Third");

// Output:
// First
// Third
// Second (after delay)
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>The event loop allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks like timers and promises in the background without freezing the entire application.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>5. Practical Example: Fetching Data from an API</h2>
        <p>Let's put all of these concepts together by fetching data from an API. Imagine you're trying to get information from a library database. While you're waiting for the data, you can still do other things in your code.</p>
        
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre><code>
// Fetching data using async/await
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log("Fetched Data:", data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    }
}

fetchData();
        </code></pre>
        
        <p><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> This pattern is very common in web development when dealing with APIs. While the data is being fetched from the server, the rest of the application can continue running, enhancing performance and user experience.</p>
    </section>

   
        <p>Asynchronous JavaScript is essential for creating responsive, efficient, and user-friendly applications. Understanding how to use callbacks, promises, async/await, and the event loop will make you a better developer, allowing you to handle multiple tasks seamlessly in your projects.</p>
