        <h2>Introduction to Primitive Data Types</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, primitive data types are the most basic types of data, representing simple values. These types are immutable, meaning that their value cannot be changed once they are created. Understanding how primitive data types work is fundamental for every JavaScript developer.</p>
        <p>In this tutorial, we will explore the different types of primitives, how they behave, and why they matter in your everyday coding.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>What Are Primitive Data Types?</h2>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of primitive data types as building blocks or atoms of a program. They represent the simplest forms of dataâ€”just like atoms are the simplest forms of matter. They cannot be broken down into anything smaller.</p>
        <p>JavaScript has the following primitive data types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Number</code></li>
            <li><code>String</code></li>
            <li><code>Boolean</code></li>
            <li><code>undefined</code></li>
            <li><code>null</code></li>
            <li><code>Symbol</code></li>
            <li><code>BigInt</code></li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Numbers</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, numbers can represent both integers and floating-point numbers.</p>
        <pre><code>let age = 25; // an integer
let pi = 3.14159; // a floating-point number
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of numbers like counters in a game. You can count lives, points, or time remaining. The number itself doesn't change (it's immutable), but you can assign it to different variables to represent different values.</p>
        <p>Numbers are often used in calculations, loops, and for tracking progress in many programming tasks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Strings</h2>
        <p>A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. It can be written with single (<code>'</code>) or double quotes (<code>"</code>), or backticks (<code>`</code>) for template literals.</p>
        <pre><code>let name = "Alice";
let greeting = 'Hello, world!';
let message = `The user's name is ${name}`;
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Think of strings like a necklace, where each bead is a character. Once you have the necklace, the arrangement of beads (characters) stays the same, even though you can create new necklaces by rearranging them.</p>
        <p>Strings are often used to store and manipulate text in programs, such as displaying messages, handling user input, or labeling data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Booleans</h2>
        <p>Booleans represent two values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. They are often used in conditional logic to determine the flow of a program.</p>
        <pre><code>let isUserLoggedIn = true;
let hasAccess = false;
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of Booleans like light switches. The switch is either on (true) or off (false), and depending on its state, your program can execute certain actions.</p>
        <p>Booleans are crucial for making decisions in your code. For example, checking whether a user has permission to access a feature or verifying if a condition is met.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. <code>undefined</code></h2>
        <p>The <code>undefined</code> type means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.</p>
        <pre><code>let notAssigned;
console.log(notAssigned); // Output: undefined
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Imagine an empty box that you haven't decided what to put in yet. The box exists, but there's nothing inside.</p>
        <p>Variables that haven't been initialized with a value automatically hold the value <code>undefined</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. <code>null</code></h2>
        <p><code>null</code> is an intentional absence of any value. It is used when you want to explicitly say that a variable has no value.</p>
        <pre><code>let emptyValue = null;
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of <code>null</code> as an empty placeholder, like reserving a table at a restaurant but leaving the chairs empty until someone arrives.</p>
        <p>Unlike <code>undefined</code>, which is automatically assigned, <code>null</code> is assigned intentionally when you want to clear a value or indicate no value.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Symbols</h2>
        <p>Symbols are unique identifiers, primarily used in more advanced coding scenarios.</p>
        <pre><code>let uniqueID = Symbol('id');
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Real-world use case:</strong> Symbols are often used in object property keys to ensure uniqueness, such as creating private properties in objects that won't clash with other properties.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. BigInt</h2>
        <p>The <code>BigInt</code> type is used for very large integers, beyond the safe integer limit of regular numbers.</p>
        <pre><code>let bigNumber = 9007199254740991n; // n at the end denotes BigInt
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> If numbers are like pebbles, BigInt numbers are like boulders, representing much larger quantities.</p>
        <p>This data type is useful when working with large calculations, like cryptography or dealing with astronomical values.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Why Do Primitive Data Types Matter?</h2>
        <p>Primitive data types are the foundation of how JavaScript handles data. They are immutable, meaning their values do not change, and they are stored by value (not reference). Understanding these properties is essential for writing efficient and bug-free code.</p>
        <p>Primitive data types play a role in memory management, performance optimization, and code readability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Practical Usage and Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Here are some best practices for working with primitive data types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use appropriate types:</strong> Make sure to choose the correct data type for the value you want to represent, such as using <code>Boolean</code> for true/false conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid confusion between <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>:</strong> Use <code>null</code> to explicitly set a value as empty, while <code>undefined</code> is for uninitialized variables.</li>
            <li><strong>Be mindful of number precision:</strong> When working with large numbers, consider using <code>BigInt</code> to avoid precision errors.</li>
        </ul>
